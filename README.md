# Description
The repository contains folders with different exercices. They are, in general, not linked by the parent folder and should  be downloaded and viewed separately. They've been grouped together for the sake of the topic and exercise.

Ej3 and Axios_to_Api are related, as Axios_to_Api sends requests to the server created in ej3.
